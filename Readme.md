Game Rules

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Two players take turns marking a space on the grid with either an "X" or an "O".

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.# Tic-Tac-Toe
